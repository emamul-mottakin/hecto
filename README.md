## UI Credit:
The Figma UI template for this project was sourced from the Figma Community. The original design, titled Project [Ecom - An E-commerce UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/967759864749832815/project-ecom-an-ecommerce-ui-kit), was created by [@saberali](https://www.figma.com/@saberali). I translated the design into code, bringing the UI to life with HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript.
